% author names and IEEE memberships
% note positions of commas and nonbreaking spaces ( ~ ) LaTeX will not break
% a structure at a ~ so this keeps an author's name from being broken across
% two lines.

% a separate \thanks must be used for each paragraph as LaTeX2e's \thanks

    \author{Michael Hegerhorst}

% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks -
% these prevent an unwanted space from occurring between the last author name
% and the end of the author line. i.e., if you had this:
%
% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those "LaTeX things". For
% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.


% The paper headers
%\markboth{Journal of \LaTeX\ Class Files,~Vol.~6, No.~1, January~2007}%
%{Shell \MakeLowercase{\textit{et al.}}: Bare Demo of IEEEtran.cls for Journals}
% The only time the second header will appear is for the odd numbered pages
% after the title page when using the twoside option.
%
% *** Note that you probably will NOT want to include the author's ***
% *** name in the headers of peer review papers.                   ***
% You can use \ifCLASSOPTIONpeerreview for conditional compilation here if
% you desire.


% If you want to put a publisher's ID mark on the page you can do it like
% this:
%\IEEEpubid{0000--0000/00\$00.00~\copyright~2007 IEEE}
% Remember, if you use this you must call \IEEEpubidadjcol in the second
% column for its text to clear the IEEEpubid mark.


% use for special paper notices

% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
% if the journal you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals frown on math
% in the abstract anyway.

% Note that keywords are not normally used for peerreview papers.

% For peerreview papers, this IEEEtran command inserts a page break and
% creates the second title. It will be ignored for other modes.
