\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Agent Type}\label{subsec:agent-type}
The average rewards by agent type can be seen in \autoref{fig:rewards-by-agent}.
Unfortunately, none of the agents were able to do as well as the controller used by the
CPT\@.
Additionally, all agents performed as bad or worse as a simple random controller!
It is possible that this problem is complex enough that the models needed more time
to train, but no significant additional gains were made when training for over 12,000
episodes, so there appears to be something wrong.

\end{figure}

Interestingly, the A2C agents seems to perform the best out of all the agents used.
DDPG seems to perform second best, while QNN performs the worst.
Further work should be done to determine why these agents aren't improving and what
changes need to be made to improve them.
The average reward for each agent is shown in \autoref{tab:agent-average-reward}.
